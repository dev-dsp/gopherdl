# gopherdl

So, it's 2017, and as far as I can tell, NO ONE has written (and made public) a
wget-like program for recursively downloading gopher menus and files. 

Maybe it's just really hard to find ANYTHING related to gopher at this point?

But, it's not a dead protocol I tell you! Gophers tunnel on, [even
today](gopher://gopher.floogdap.com)!

### Get to the point already

`gopherdl` is a Python3 program intended to mirror wget in terms of commandline
options and basic features. It's not finished yet, but the basic goal is to be
able to recursively entire gopher sites and menus.
